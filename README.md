# Portfolio
Hey there! I am Rvvshid04 and this is my portfolio. It's still in development. Just 'jumped' into it. 
Started on 30/05/2024 at 12:05 AM. 

Changes to be made:
-Removing the testimonials & experiences section
-Removing the legend in the skills section and the ratings system. 
    -Many of them, I've only had to apply it a few times, like SQL. Personally, I feel my SQL is still in the Hello World         stage, sure I understand DFD Diagrams, ERD and Normalization. But the practical applications of each of them is still        iffy. Even my JS needs some working on.
    
## Planning out the portfolio

1. Domain name and hosting: For the moment, I'll stick to GitHub pages. Been recommended to try out Vercel though.

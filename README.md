# Portfolio
Hey there! I am Raashid Arquil and this is my portfolio. (It's still in development. Started on 30/05/2024 at 12:05 AM. )

## Changes to be made:
- Removing the testimonials & experiences section
- Removing the legend in the skills section and the ratings system. 
    - Many of them, I've only had to apply it a few times, like SQL. Personally, I feel my SQL is still in the Hello World stage, sure I understand DFD Diagrams, ERD and Normalization. But the practical applications of each of them is still        iffy. Even my JS needs some working on.

## Parts of the website to be built or have already been built: 
- Home Landing Page
- About Section
- Skills/Technologies Section
- Projects Section
- Contact Section
- Footer Section

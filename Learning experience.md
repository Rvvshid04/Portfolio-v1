The troubles I currently have with CSS:
the concept and usage of position
display inline-block, block??, ???
types of transition/transform and its application
nth-child, first-child etc.
CSS Grid
CSS Flexbox, certain usages of flexbox and the differences they make on the webpage like align-items/ align-contents, etc.
usages/when to use 'opacity'
overflow, cover?, hidden?- just how does it work and to what extent 
white-space, what??? just found out there is such a thing in css, I mean, I've heard of white space as a design concept, but in CSS...
